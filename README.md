Data analytics project leveraging Google BigQuery, SQL, Power Query, and Power BI to build interactive dashboards with DAX, delivering insights on sales trends, pricing patterns, regional performance, and housing market analysis.


# 🏡 House Market Analysis – Google BigQuery & Power BI

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics pipeline** for analyzing housing market trends. The dataset was loaded into **Google BigQuery**, cleaned and transformed using **SQL** & **Power Query**, and finally visualized in **Power BI** to deliver actionable insights for decision-making.

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

* **Data Warehouse:** Google BigQuery
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** SQL, Power Query Editor
* **Visualization & Reporting:** Power BI
* **DAX Functions:** YOY Sales Growth, Median Sales Price Change, Units Sold, 12-Month Sales

## 🚀 **Key Steps**

1. **Data Loading:** Imported housing dataset (CSV) into Google BigQuery.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled null values, updated SQM for missing records, and created calculated columns (e.g., Offer Price).
3. **SQL in BigQuery:** Performed profiling, updates, and transformations for structured reporting.
4. **Power BI Dashboards:** Built interactive dashboards with custom **DAX measures** and KPIs.
5. **Insights Generation:** Translated raw data into **business-driven insights** to guide sales strategy.

## 📊 **Insights & Findings**

* **Regional Trends:** Zealand & Jutland account for **80%+ of sales**, dominating the housing market.
* **Sales Type Analysis:** Auction sales grew by **29% YoY**, while family and regular sales declined.
* **House Type Trends:**

  * Apartments → highest price per SQM (**28.7K**) despite smaller size.
  * Farms → largest size (avg. **196 SQM**) but lowest per SQM price (**13.8K**).
  * Summerhouses → cheapest overall (\~**1.2M** average purchase price).
* **Performance Metrics:** \~**77 units sold** in the latest quarter and **13B total sales** in the last 12 months.


## 🛠️ **Skills Demonstrated**

* Google BigQuery
* Power BI & Data Visualization
* SQL (Data Profiling, Cleaning, Transformations)
* Power Query Editor
* DAX (Advanced Measures & KPIs)
